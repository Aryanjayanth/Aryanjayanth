                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Create a study timetable that breaks down what you need to study each day. Stick to this schedule to stay on track.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Go through previous years’ exam papers to identify frequently tested topics and understand the structure of the questions.</p>

                    <h3>Active Recall and Spaced Repetition</h3>
                    <p>Active recall involves testing yourself on the material instead of passively reading. Spaced repetition ensures that you review the material at increasing intervals to reinforce memory.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use flashcards or apps like Anki to test your knowledge regularly. Space out your revisions over days or weeks to retain information better.</p>
